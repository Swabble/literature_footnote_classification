You are given a list of literature entries and a list of footnotes.

Your task is to match only those footnotes to a literature entry that fulfill both of the following strict conditions:

The surname of the author in the literature entry must match exactly the author name mentioned in the footnote.

If the footnote uses “et al.”, only the first listed surname must match exactly the literature entry author’s surname.

If the literature entry has only one author and the footnote lists multiple names (not "et al."), it is not a match.

The publication year must match exactly.

You must internally check each footnote-literature pair for:

Exact surname match (no partial or fuzzy match).

Exact year match.

Only if both are true, include the footnote in the result.

Do not use content similarity, context clues, or assumptions.

Return only the final result as a valid JSON object in this format:

Do not include any explanation, reasoning steps, tables, or additional text — return the JSON object only.
