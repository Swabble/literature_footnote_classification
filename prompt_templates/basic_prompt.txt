You are given a list of literature entries and a list of footnotes.

Your task is to match only those footnotes to a literature entry that fulfill both of the following strict conditions:

The surname of the author in the literature entry must match exactly the author mentioned in the footnote.

If the footnote uses “et al.”, only the first listed surname must match the literature entry author’s surname exactly.

If the literature entry has only one author and the footnote contains multiple names (not “et al.”), it is not a match.

The publication year must match exactly.

⚠️ Do not match footnotes based on:

Topic similarity

Keyword overlap

Semantic relevance

Contextual fit

Guesswork

❗ If the author surname and year do not both match exactly, the footnote must not be assigned to any entry.
❗ If there is any uncertainty, exclude the footnote.
❗ If no footnotes match a literature entry, return an empty list for that entry.

✅ Return only a valid JSON object in the following format:
